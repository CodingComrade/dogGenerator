About this project: This dog generator website uses the Dog.ceo API. 

How it works: On the home page, the user first selects a dog from the dropdown menu, then clicks the new dog button. Every time the user clicks the new dog button, the dog the user selected is sent to the Dog API and an image is sent back of the requested dog.

What is the Donate link? Clicking this link will send you to the donation page. I have provided links to various donation centers for dog rescue groups and provided a brief description below the links.

What is the Info link? Clicking this link will send you to the info page. I created a table that lists all the dogs in the dropdown menu, plus basic information about the dog such as weight and country of origin.
